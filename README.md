The Hospital Management backend using Hibernate is structured to handle different aspects of hospital operations efficiently. It uses Hibernate ORM for managing data persistence, allowing for smooth interaction with the database. The backend is divided into four main packages: `dtao`, `dao`, `service`, and `control`.

The `dtao` package contains the core entity classes like Hospital, Branch, Encounter, MedOrder, Item, Address, User, Person, and Observation, each representing different parts of the hospital system. The `dao` package is responsible for database interactions, where each entity has a corresponding DAO class to perform CRUD operations.

The `service` package holds the business logic, acting as a bridge between the database layer and the controllers. It processes the data and handles complex operations before passing them to the control layer. The `control` package manages the RESTful APIs, handling HTTP requests and responses, and connecting the frontend to the backend.

Overall, this backend supports efficient data management and seamless communication across various components of the hospital system, ensuring streamlined hospital operations.
